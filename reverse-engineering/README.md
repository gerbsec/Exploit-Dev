# Reverse Engineering for bugs

1. **TCP View**
  - Use TCPView to figure out what ports are open. This will help us decide what port to attack.

2. **Windbg**
  - After finding the port, we need to be able to interact with it. So to start we'll hook the recv API:
  - `bp wsock32!recv`, `g`
  - Next write a script that interacts with the service. In our example's case we use simple socket and send 100*A's.
  - Next we can check out the DOWRDs from the stack `dd esp L5`. Based on the output any data received will be copied into the buffer located at 0x00df8058 with the maximum length of 0x4400 bytes. This was out of the example.
  - ```
    0d85fb58  00581ae8 00000b6c 00df8058 00004400
    0d85fb68  00000000
    ```
  - Then we can continue execution till end of recv and checkout eax: `pt`
  - `? [value of eax]`
  - `dd [value from before]`
  - We can dump the app call stack with `k`. That will show us what application we need to use with IDA.
  - `lm m [module_name]` will show us location on disk
